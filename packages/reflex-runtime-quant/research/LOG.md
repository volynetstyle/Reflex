# Design log

One entry per mechanism, in the order the tests forced them. Each entry
names the counterexample (a test, probe or mutant in this package), the
invariant it violates, the repair, the alternative rejected and the cost.
Mutant ids refer to `research/mutants.mjs`; probe ids to
`test/support/probes.ts`.

### 1. Versions on nodes and relations

- **Counterexample:** P6 (direct ABA, 0 → 1 → 0 between runs: the watcher
  must run); `semantics.test.ts` "a write to a not-yet-read source during
  the run adds no rerun".
- **Invariant:** change is a version fact, not a value fact (spec); exact
  cutoff for a push into a running pass (L2, L3).
- **Repair:** `node.version` bumps on every `Object.is`-visible change; each
  relation stores the version its consumer read. Push only marks STALE;
  validation compares versions in read order and stops at the first change.
- **Rejected:** value snapshots (ABA); Reflex's `Changed` on direct push
  plus one-step push, which needs a prefix classifier (stamps) to decide
  whether a push into a running pass hit an already-read source. Mutant
  `direct-dirty-running` is that classifier missing: killed.
- **Cost:** one node field, one relation field, one store per tracked read.

### 2. Read-ordered dependency list with a cursor

- **Measurement:** a stable trace must cost one comparison per read, no
  allocation, no lookup (`structure.test.ts` "stable graph").
- **Invariant (derived):** existential validation does no wasted work only
  if the list order is the last read order: a source is refreshed only when
  every earlier one is unchanged, so a deterministic re-execution would read
  it anyway.
- **Repair:** `deps` in read order, `cursor` = last accepted relation; a
  read compares the next relation's source. Doubly linked, so a relation
  moves to the cursor in O(1).
- **Cost:** `cursor` node field, `prevDep`/`nextDep` relation fields.

### 3. Exact membership: slot index and displaced cells

- **Counterexample:** duplicate after prefix (P0..P127 then P32); old twin
  (a nested pass subscribes to the source between two reads, defeating a
  last-subscriber check); random permutation of 64 shared sources (a scan
  is Θ(d²)); mutants `no-unread`, `no-displaced`.
- **Invariant:** one relation per (source, consumer) pair; graph size
  proportional to live relations; no Θ(d²) tracking.
- **Repair:** on the first miss a cheap check cannot resolve, index the
  consumer once: each relation goes into its source's `slot`, unread ones
  are marked `UNREAD`. Then every read is O(1) and exact: duplicate, move,
  or new. A nested indexed pass saves the cells it displaces on a shared
  stack and restores them at its end; LIFO nesting makes one stack enough.
- **Rejected:** per-consumer `Map`/`Set` (allocation and hashing per pass);
  a rollback field per relation (preact: a permanent field for a transient
  need); a linear scan (Θ(d²) on permutations).
- **Cost:** one node field (`slot`), one transient array, an O(d) walk only
  in passes that need it.

### 4. Prune on success only

- **Counterexample:** P5 (a committed dependency the failed attempt did not
  reach must still wake the watcher); mutant `cut-on-failure`.
- **Invariant:** W3, R2.
- **Repair:** a successful pass removes the unread suffix; a failed pass
  keeps it.
- **Cost:** none.

### 5. Exact retry set: success generation (kernel v0 → v1)

- **Counterexample:** P3 (v0 validated a computed read only by the failed
  attempt, so a validation failure made a plain flush retry) and P4 (v0
  kept the reads of every failed attempt, so a source read only by an
  earlier failure woke the watcher). Reflex shows both behaviours.
  Mutants `validate-tentative`, `keep-tentative`.
- **Invariant:** W2/V3: only the committed set is validated; the wake set is
  committed ∪ the last attempt's reads.
- **Repair:** `node.gen` counts successful passes; a relation is born with
  `gen = node.gen + 1`, so it is tentative exactly while `edge.gen ===
  node.gen + 1`. Watcher validation skips tentative relations; a failed pass
  drops unread tentative ones. Success costs one store, no walk.
- **Rejected:** a committed bit cleared by a walk at every success; a global
  pass clock (same fields plus a register). MODEL LB2 says Ω(m) bits are
  needed once failures rewrite history, so a per-relation field is the floor.
- **Cost:** one node field, one relation field. `research/versions/` keeps
  v0 and v1.

### 6. A failure leaves DIRTY, for watchers too

- **Counterexample:** P9 and the generated witness gen-1366: a failed run
  owes an execution, and a later wake through a computed that comes out
  unchanged must still run it. Reflex returns the watcher to idle
  (INVARIANTS §3) and drops it. Mutant `idle-after-failure`.
- **Invariant:** R2.
- **Repair:** a failed pass sets DIRTY on any node.
- **Cost:** none.

### 7. Failed validation leaves DIRTY; watchers are always re-delivered

- **Counterexample:** `semantics.test.ts` "after a failed validation the
  effect is re-delivered when its cause changes". With STALE kept on the
  failed computed, push stops there and the effect is stranded. Mutants
  `validation-stale`, `deliver-once`.
- **Invariant:** liveness of a scheduled host (L1).
- **Repair:** a computed whose validation throws becomes DIRTY (not STALE),
  so a push passes it; every push to a watcher calls the host, and the host
  deduplicates.
- **Cost:** none.

### 8. Clear STALE before the pass, never after

- **Counterexample:** an effect that writes a source it read must converge;
  a computed that writes its own source (F1). Mutant `clear-after`.
- **Repair:** STALE|DIRTY are cleared when the pass starts. A push during
  the pass re-marks the node and versions settle it on the next read. F1
  converges here; in Reflex it is open.
- **Cost:** none.

### 9. Deferred disposal

- **Counterexample:** an effect disposes itself mid-pass and keeps
  reading: an eager unlink leaves the cursor on a detached relation, and a
  new relation hangs off it (ghost subscription, stale slot cells). Mutant
  `eager-dispose`.
- **Repair:** `dispose` of a RUNNING node only clears `fn`; the pass's end
  unlinks.
- **Cost:** none (RUNNING exists for cycles).

### 10. RUNNING: cycle check

- **Counterexample:** `semantics.test.ts` "cycles throw". Mutant
  `no-cycle-check`.
- **Cost:** one bit, in the same mask as STALE|DIRTY on read.

### 11. Host: scheduled runs only inside the drain loop

- **Counterexample:** an effect's first run outside the drain loop wrote its
  own source; the nested flush saw it RUNNING and dropped it (lost
  re-delivery, L1). Mutant `run-direct`.
- **Repair:** `effect()` queues and flushes. Effects created inside a batch
  or another effect run after it.

### 12. Removed: run() guard against a watcher on the stack

- Mutant `no-running-guard` survived the whole suite: no API path can reach
  it, because `flush` is not reentrant and `run` is not public. Removed, and
  kept as a host precondition.

### 13. Optimizations O1, O2 (structural measurement)

- **Measurement:** `bench/structure.mjs`. value-sort indexed 8,224 relations
  per step to perform 63 moves; insert-one and rotate indexed 257 per pass;
  every direct write made the computed re-walk its dependencies first.
- **O1:** before indexing, try two cheap exact answers. (a) The relation
  after `next` is the read's unique relation: move it. (b) The source has
  at most 8 subscribers, none of them this consumer: absence is proven.
  Index walks drop to 0 on rotate, value-sort, insert-one and replace-half,
  and branch-switch lookups to 0.
- **O2:** a write marks direct subscribers DIRTY, except RUNNING ones
  (item 1).
- Mutants `no-skip`, `no-absence-scan`, `no-direct-dirty` survive every
  semantic test and fail only `structure.test.ts`: optimizations, not
  semantics.

### 14. Kept as a convention: subscribers in birth order

- Mutant `prepend-subs` fails only tests that assert sibling effect order,
  which SEMANTIC_CONTRACT leaves open. `subsTail` stays for deterministic
  FIFO effect order (as in Reflex and alien); it is not an invariant.
