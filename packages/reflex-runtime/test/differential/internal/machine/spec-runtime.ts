 * Deliberately slow executable correctness model.
 *
 * Semantic core:
 *
 *   committed value

 *   + committed direct dependency frontier
 *   + tentative observations
 *   + commit / abort
 *
 * Watcher semantics adds two independent obligations:
 *
 *   validation obligation
 *   + execution obligation
 *
 * Failure recovery adds a separate non-semantic mechanism:
 *
 *   conservative causal wake evidence
 *
 * The three facts that must never be conflated are:
 *
 *   causal change != semantic change != execution obligation
 *
 * In particular:
 *
 * - A computed is a semantic boundary for committed observations.
 * - Retry evidence may recursively cross that boundary because it only wakes a
 *   failed attempt; it does not assert downstream semantic change.
 * - Waking a failed watcher does not create its execution obligation. That
 *   obligation was established before the failed lifecycle/computation began
 *   and remains pending until successful completion.
 *
 * There is no subscriber graph, dirty-bit state machine, scheduler, push
 * propagation, edge reuse, cursor traversal, ownership or batching here.
 * Those are production refinements, not sources of observable truth.
 *
 * Correctness rules encoded by this model:
 *
 * 1. Successful dependency observations are tentative until their enclosing
 *    computation succeeds.
 * 2. Failed computation does not commit value, semantic version or dependency
 *    frontier.
 * 3. A computed is a semantic boundary: downstream commits only the computed's
 *    semantic version, never versions of its internal leaves.
 * 4. A computed read is observed only after successful stabilization. A
 *    first-time computed read that throws is therefore not a semantic
 *    dependency and, under the current Reflex contract, is not separately
 *    retained as retry evidence. Retaining such failed reads would be a
 *    deliberate future semantic extension, not a clarification of current
 *    behavior.
 * 5. Watcher validation and execution are independent obligations.
 * 6. The complete committed watcher frontier must validate before irreversible
 *    watcher lifecycle begins, even when execution is already pending.
 * 7. Cleanup is consumed before invocation and cannot be resurrected on error.
 * 8. Failed cleanup/computation preserves an already-established watcher
 *    execution obligation.
 * 9. Retry evidence is a failure-time causal wake set only. It may recursively
 *    cross computed boundaries, but never becomes a semantic dependency
 *    frontier and never creates an execution obligation.
 *
 * The model assumes synchronous, acyclic evaluation. Writes during reactive
 * execution, scheduler ownership and cycle semantics are outside this oracle's
 * current boundary and must not be inferred from this implementation.
