/**
 * Whether `edge`, read from `node.tailIn`, is an outgoing hint rather than an
 * incoming edge (INV-H).
 *
 * `tailIn` is one slot with two lifetime-disjoint readings. While the node
 * is Computing it is the tracking frontier: null or an incoming edge. While
 * it is not, the frontier reading is inactive and the slot holds null, the
 * residual incoming edge of the last pass, or a hint: one attached outgoing
 * edge of the node, left by the last lookup past the head start
 * (findEdgeInLockstep).
 *
 * The readings are told apart by direction: an incoming edge has
 * `to === node`, a hint has `from === node && to !== node`. A self-edge
 * satisfies both endpoint tests and always reads as incoming; the lookup
 * never writes one, since a self-read comes from the computing node itself.
 *
 * Maintenance: a hint is written only while the node is neither Computing
 * nor a watcher, every unlink of an edge clears the hint that points to it,
 * and every computation clears the slot before it becomes a frontier. So
 * whatever the slot holds is attached, a stale hint is never observed, and
 * the lookup may use any slot edge that matches its pair. A hint is a
 * positive answer only and proves nothing about absence.
