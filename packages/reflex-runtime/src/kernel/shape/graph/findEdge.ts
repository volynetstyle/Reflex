/**
 * Find the edge `producer -> consumer`, or prove that there is none.
 *
 * A pair has at most one edge, and that edge is on both the producer's
 * outgoing list and the consumer's incoming list. The search first probes
 * two outgoing edges, then walks both lists in lockstep until either side
 * finds the pair or proves that it is absent. A lookup therefore costs
 * O(min(out(producer), in(consumer)) + 2) links whichever side is short,
 * plus a bounded constant when the producer holds a finger.
 *
 * The outgoing side is walked from `producer.firstOut`. The incoming side is
 * walked outward from a known position: `back` follows `prevIn`, `ahead`
 * follows `nextIn`. Together with the incoming edges the caller has already
 * compared, they must cover the whole incoming list. Exhausting that covered
 * incoming search is therefore a proof of absence.
 *
 * The producer's slot (INV-H, see `isOutgoingHint`) is consulted twice. An
 * edge of exactly this pair is the answer, before anything else. Any other
 * edge from the producer is a finger: the edge found by the last lookup of
 * this producer past its head start. `P.out` is append-only, so it lists the
 * consumers in the order they linked the producer, which is the order they
 * ran; consumers that re-run in that order find their edge near the previous
 * consumer's, however each orders its own reads. Past the head start the
 * lockstep therefore also races a bounded walk around the finger
 * (findEdgeInLockstepFromFinger). The edge found by either becomes the hint.
 *
 * Hint and finger are positive answers only: a miss proves nothing, and
 * absence is established only by exhausting the outgoing or the covered
 * incoming search, or, for the owner of a live prepared tape, by the tape's
 * certificate (INV-P, graph/tape.ts).
 *
 * Prepared tape. When the finger race settles only in its far end, or the
 * lookup enters the plain lockstep, a computing consumer strikes; enough
 * strikes in one pass prepare its incoming list as a tape whose cells are
 * the producers' slots, so the hint probe above answers its existing pairs.
 * The tape is consulted only at the entries of the two continuations below.
 *
 * JIT: this function is byte-identical without the tape. Its bytecode is
 * charged to every caller that inlines the read chain, and those callers
 * have about 20 bytes of TurboFan inlining budget left (A.track.hub-
 * duplicate, Node 24); the continuations are inlined only where lookups
 * reach them.
