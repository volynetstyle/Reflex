/**
 * The prepared tape: direct addressing of one consumer's incoming list,
 * entered when the pair lookup's locality stops paying (INV-P,
 * docs/INVARIANTS.md).
 *
 * The incoming list of a consumer C is an ordered tape of edges. Preparing
 * it writes, once, every producer's slot to its own cell of that tape:
 * `P.tailIn = edge(P -> C)`, an ordinary outgoing hint under INV-H. The
 * lookup's first probe, the hint, then answers every existing pair of C in
 * one comparison, and the order is still materialized by the usual moves of
 * existing edges. Nothing is created, moved or unlinked, so a throw at any
 * point leaves the graph the lookup would have left.
 *
 * Trigger. A lookup that leaves the locality tiers for the plain lockstep,
 * or whose finger race settles only in the far end of its window, is a
 * strike of its tracking pass. The second strike of a pass
 * prepares the tape. A tracking pass is named by (consumer, pass stamp);
 * the stamp alone is not unique across consumers. Another pass striking in
 * between restarts the count, so nesting only ever delays a prepare.
 *
 * Lease. The prepared consumer and its pass stamp: at most one at a time.
 * Live(C, s) holds while C is Computing and its frontier carries s. A dead
 * lease needs no eager cleanup: its cells are hints, the next prepare
 * replaces it, the owner's next miss past the hint releases it.
 *
 * Certificate. Under a live lease with coverage, every producer of an
 * attached incoming edge of the owner carries `Leased` (set by the prepare
 * and by every link to the owner). An idle producer without the bit
 * therefore has no edge to the owner: a hint miss on it proves absence. A
 * bit without a cell (a computation of the producer, another consumer's
 * hint, a raw kernel frame took the slot) sends the lookup on to the exact
 * search, so a lost cell costs a lookup, never a twin.
